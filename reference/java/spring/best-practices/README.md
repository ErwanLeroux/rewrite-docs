# Best Practices

This collection of visitors promotes best practices for Spring and Spring Boot applications, but are not tied to a migration effort per se. 

For example, it is no longer necessary for `@Bean` methods to be public, but many methods in the wild still have public visibility as a holdover from a time when it was required. Being consistent about these types of best practices makes your code more pleasant to work with.
