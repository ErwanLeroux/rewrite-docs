# Use diamond operator

**org.openrewrite.java.cleanup.UseDiamondOperator**  
_The diamond operator (`<>`) should be used. Java 7 introduced the diamond operator (<>) to reduce the verbosity of generics code. For instance, instead of having to declare a List's type in both its declaration and its constructor, you can now simplify the constructor declaration with `<>`, and the compiler will infer the type._
